## Summary
- The code runs the renderAnimals function connected to see all animals button.
- When this button is clicked it runs the fetch function.
- The fetch method takes data and parses it into a javascript object that can be operated on.
- Once the fetch method completes it feeds the information to function post with the parsed json object as the parameter.
- The function for post iterates through each object and creates a div to hold the post and a comment section.
- The function implements a like button that allows only one vote.
- When the like button is clicked twice it undoes the vote.
- The comment section also implement functions that allow one to delete the comment.
